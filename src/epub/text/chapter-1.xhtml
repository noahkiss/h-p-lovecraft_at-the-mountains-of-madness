			<p>I am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow my advice without knowing why. It is altogether against my will that I tell my reasons for opposing this contemplated invasion of the Antarctic⁠—with its vast fossil hunt and its wholesale boring and melting of the ancient ice caps. And I am the more reluctant because my warning may be in vain.</p>
			<p>Doubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet, if I suppressed what will seem extravagant and incredible there would be nothing left. The hitherto withheld photographs, both ordinary and aerial, will count in my favor, for they are damnably vivid and graphic. Still, they will be doubted because of the great lengths to which clever fakery can be carried. The ink drawings, of course, will be jeered at as obvious impostures; notwithstanding a strangeness and technique which art experts ought to remark and puzzle over.</p>
			<p>In the end I must rely on the judgment and standing of the few scientific leaders who have, on the one hand, sufficient independence of thought to weigh my data on its own hideously convincing merits or in the light of certain primordial and highly baffling myth cycles; and on the other hand, sufficient influence to deter the exploring world in general from any rash and overambitious program in the region of those mountains of madness.</p>
			<p>It is an unfortunate fact that relatively obscure men like myself and my associates, connected only with a small university, have little chance of making an impression where matters of a wildly bizarre or highly controversial natures are concerned.</p>
			<p>It is further against us that we are not, in the strictest sense, specialists in the fields which came primarily to be concerned. As a geologist, my object in leading the Miskatonic University Expedition was wholly that of securing deep-level specimens of rock and soil from various parts of the Antarctic continent, aided by the remarkable drill devised by Professor Frank <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Pabodie of our engineering department.</p>
			<p>I had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this, but I did hope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points along previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a sort hitherto unreached by the ordinary methods of collection.</p>
			<p>Pabodie’s drilling apparatus, as the public already knows from our reports, was unique and radical in its lightness, portability, and capacity to combine the ordinary Artesian drill principle with the principle of the small circular rock drill in such a way as to cope quickly with strata of varying hardness.</p>
			<p>Steel head, jointed rods, gasoline motor, collapsible wooden derrick, dynamiting paraphernalia, cording, rubbish-removal auger, and sectional piping for bores five inches wide and up to one thousand feet deep all formed, with needed accessories, no greater load than three seven-dog sledges could carry. This was made possible by the clever aluminum alloy of which most of the metal objects were fashioned.</p>
			<p>Four large Dornier aeroplanes, designed especially for the tremendous altitude flying necessary on the Antarctic plateau and with added fuel-warming and quick-starting devices worked out by Pabodie, could transport our entire expedition from a base at the edge of the great ice barrier to various suitable inland points, and from these points a sufficient quota of dogs would serve us.</p>
			<p>We planned to cover as great an area as one Antarctic season⁠—or longer, if absolutely necessary⁠—would permit, operating mostly in the mountain ranges and on the plateau south of Ross Sea; regions explored in varying degree by Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott, and Byrd. With frequent changes of camp, made by aeroplane and involving distances great enough to be of geological significance, we expected to unearth a quite unprecedented amount of material⁠—especially in the pre-Cambrian strata of which so narrow a range of Antarctic specimens had previously been secured.</p>
			<p>We wished also to obtain as great as possible a variety of the upper fossiliferous rocks, since the primal life history of this bleak realm of ice and death is of the highest importance to our knowledge of the earth’s past. That the Antarctic continent was once temperate and even tropical, with a teeming vegetable and animal life of which the lichens, marine fauna, Arachnida, and penguins of the northern edge are the only survivors, is a matter of common information; and we hoped to expand that information in variety, accuracy, and detail. When a simple boring revealed fossiliferous signs, we would enlarge the aperture by blasting, in order to get specimens of suitable size and condition.</p>
			<p>Our borings, of varying depth according to the promise held out by the upper soil or rock, were to be confined to exposed, or nearly exposed, land surfaces⁠—these inevitably being slopes and ridges because of the mile or two-mile thickness of solid ice overlying the lower levels.</p>
			<p>We could not afford to waste drilling depth on any considerable amount of more glaciation, though Pabodie had worked out a plan for sinking copper electrodes in thick clusters of borings and melting off limited areas of ice with current from a gasoline-driven dynamo.</p>
			<p>It is this plan⁠—which we could not put into effect except experimentally on an expedition such as ours⁠—that the coming Starkweather-Moore Expedition proposes to follow, despite the warnings I have issued since our return from the Antarctic.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The public knows of the Miskatonic Expedition through our frequent wireless reports to the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Arkham Advertiser</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Associated Press</i>, and through the later articles by Pabodie and myself. We consisted of four men from the University⁠—Pabodie, Lake of the biology department, Atwood of the physics department⁠—also a meteorologist⁠—and myself, representing geology and having nominal command, also sixteen assistants: seven graduate students from Miskatonic and nine skilled mechanics.</p>
			<p>Of these sixteen, twelve were qualified aeroplane pilots, all but two of whom were competent wireless operators. Eight of them understood navigation with compass and sextant, as did Pabodie, Atwood and I. In addition, of course, our two ships⁠—wooden ex-whalers, reinforced for ice conditions and having auxiliary steam⁠—were fully manned.</p>
			<p>The Nathaniel Derby Pickman Foundation, aided by a few special contributions, financed the expedition; hence our preparations were extremely thorough, despite the absence of great publicity.</p>
			<p>The dogs, sledges, machines, camp materials, and unassembled parts of our five planes were delivered in Boston, and there our ships were loaded.</p>
			<p>We were marvelously well-equipped for our specific purposes, and in all matters pertaining to supplies, regimen, transportation, and camp construction we profited by the excellent example of our many recent and exceptionally brilliant predecessors. It was the unusual number and fame of these predecessors which made our own expedition⁠—ample though it was⁠—so little noticed by the world at large.</p>
			<p>As the newspapers told, we sailed from Boston Harbor on September 2nd, 1930, taking a leisurely course down the coast and through the Panama Canal, and stopping at Samoa and Hobart, Tasmania, at which latter place we took on final supplies.</p>
			<p>None of our exploring party had ever been in the polar regions before, hence we all relied greatly on our ship captains⁠—<abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. B.</abbr> Douglas, commanding the brig <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Arkham</i>, and serving as commander of the sea party, and Georg Thorfinnssen, commanding the barque <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Miskatonic</i>⁠—both veteran whalers in Antarctic waters.</p>
			<p>As we left the inhabited world behind the sun sank lower and lower in the north, and stayed longer and longer above the horizon each day. At about 62° South Latitude we sighted our first icebergs⁠—tablelike objects with vertical sides⁠—and just before reaching the Antarctic circle, which we crossed on October 20th with appropriately quaint ceremonies, we were considerably troubled with field ice.</p>
			<p>The falling temperature bothered me considerably after our long voyage through the tropics, but I tried to brace up for the worse rigors to come. On many occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me vastly; these included a strikingly vivid mirage⁠—the first I had ever seen⁠—in which distant bergs became the battlements of unimaginable cosmic castles.</p>
			<p>Pushing through the ice, which was fortunately neither extensive nor thickly packed, we regained open water at South Latitude 67°, East Longitude 175°. On the morning of October 26th a strong land blink appeared on the south, and before noon we all felt a thrill of excitement at beholding a vast, lofty, and snow-clad mountain chain which opened out and covered the whole vista ahead. At last we had encountered an outpost of the great unknown continent and its cryptic world of frozen death.</p>
			<p>These peaks were obviously the Admiralty Range discovered by Ross, and it would now be our task to round Cape Adare and sail down the east coast of Victoria Land to our contemplated base on the shore of McMurdo Sound, at the foot of the volcano Erebus in South Latitude 77° 9′.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The last lap of the voyage was vivid and fancy-stirring. Great barren peaks of mystery loomed up constantly against the west as the low northern sun of noon or the still lower horizon-grazing southern sun of midnight poured its hazy reddish rays over the white snow, bluish ice and water lanes, and black bits of exposed granite slope.</p>
			<p>Through the desolate summits swept raging, intermittent gusts of the terrible Antarctic wind, whose cadences sometimes held vague suggestions of a wild and half-sentient musical piping, with notes extending over a wide range, and which for some subconscious mnemonic reason seemed to me disquieting and even dimly terrible.</p>
			<p>Something about the scene reminded me of the strange and disturbing Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich, and of the still stranger and more disturbing descriptions of the evilly fabled plateau of Leng which occur in the dreaded <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Necronomicon</i> of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. I was rather sorry, later on, that I had ever looked into that monstrous book at the college library.</p>
			<p>On the 7th of November, sight of the westward range having been temporarily lost, we passed Franklin Island; and the next day descried the cones of <abbr>Mts.</abbr> Erebus and Terror on Ross Island ahead, with the long line of the Parry Mountains beyond. There now stretched off to the east the low, white line of the great ice barrier, rising perpendicularly to a height of two hundred feet like the rocky cliffs of Quebec, and marking the end of southward navigation.</p>
			<p>In the afternoon we entered McMurdo Sound and stood off the coast in the lee of smoking <abbr>Mt.</abbr> Erebus. The scoriaceous peak towered up some twelve thousand seven hundred feet against the eastern sky, like a Japanese print of the sacred Fujiyama, while beyond it rose the white, ghostlike height of <abbr>Mt.</abbr> Terror, ten thousand nine hundred feet in altitude, and now extinct as a volcano.</p>
			<p>Puffs of smoke from Erebus came intermittently, and one of the graduate assistants⁠—a brilliant young fellow named Danforth⁠—pointed out what looked like lava on the snowy slope, remarking that this mountain, discovered in 1840, had undoubtedly been the source of Poe’s image when he wrote seven years later:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span class="i1">“⁠—the lavas that restlessly roll</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the ultimate climes of the pole⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the realms of the boreal pole.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Danforth was a great reader of bizarre material, and had talked a good deal of Poe. I was interested myself because of the Antarctic scene of Poe’s only long story⁠—the disturbing and enigmatical <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Arthur Gordon Pym</i>. On the barren shore, and on the lofty ice barrier in the background, myriad of grotesque penguins squawked and flapped their fins, while many fat seals were visible on the water, swimming or sprawling across large cakes of slowly drifting ice.</p>
			<p>Using small boats, we effected a difficult landing on Ross Island shortly after midnight, on the morning of the 9th, carrying a line of cable from each of the ships and preparing to unload supplies by means of a breeches buoy arrangement.</p>
			<p>Our sensations on first treading Antarctic soil were poignant and complex, even though at this particular point the Scott and Shackleton expeditions had preceded us.</p>
			<p>Our camp on the frozen shore below the volcano’s slope was only a provisional one, headquarters being kept aboard the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Arkham</i>. We landed all our drilling apparatus, dogs, sledges, tents, provisions, gasoline tanks, experimental ice-melting outfit, cameras, both ordinary and aerial, aeroplane parts, and other accessories, including three small portable wireless outfits⁠—besides those in the planes⁠—capable of communicating with the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Arkham</i>’s large outfit from any part of the Antarctic continent that we would be likely to visit.</p>
			<p>The ship’s outfit, communicating with the outside world, was to convey press reports to the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Arkham Advertiser</i>’s powerful wireless station on Kingsport Head, <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:place">Mass.</abbr> We hoped to complete our work during a single Antarctic summer; but if this proved impossible we would winter on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Arkham</i>, sending the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Miskatonic</i> north before the freezing of the ice for another summer’s supplies.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>I need not repeat what the newspapers have already published about our early work: of our ascent of <abbr>Mt.</abbr> Erebus; our successful mineral borings at several points on Ross Island and the singular speed with which Pabodie’s apparatus accomplished them, even through solid rock layers; our provisional test of the small ice-melting equipment; our perilous ascent of the great barrier with sledges and supplies; and our final assembling of five huge aeroplanes at the camp atop the barrier.</p>
			<p>The health of our land party⁠—twenty men and fifty-five Alaskan sledge dogs⁠—was remarkable, though of course we had so far encountered no really destructive temperatures or windstorms.</p>
			<p>For the most part, the thermometer varied between zero and 20° or 25° above, and our experience with New England winters had accustomed us to rigors of this sort. The barrier camp was semipermanent, and destined to be a storage cache for gasoline, provisions, dynamite, and other supplies.</p>
			<p>Only four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring material, the fifth being left with a pilot and two men, from the ships, at the storage cache to form a means of reaching us from the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Arkham</i> in case all our exploring planes were lost.</p>
			<p>Later, when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus, we would employ one or two in a shuttle transportation service between this cache and another permanent base on the great plateau from six hundred to seven hundred miles southward, beyond Beardmore Glacier.</p>
			<p>Despite the almost unanimous accounts of appalling winds and tempests that pour down from the plateau, we determined to dispense with intermediate bases, taking our chances in the interest of economy and probable efficiency.</p>
			<p>Wireless reports have spoken of the breathtaking, four-hour, nonstop flight of our squadron on November 21st over the lofty shelf ice, with vast peaks rising on the west, and the unfathomed silences echoing to the sound of our engines.</p>
			<p>Wind troubled us only moderately, and our radio compasses helped us through the one opaque fog we encountered. When the vast rise loomed ahead, between Latitudes 83° and 84°, we knew we had reached Beardmore Glacier, the largest valley glacier in the world, and that the frozen sea was now giving place to a frowning and mountainous coast line.</p>
			<p>At last we were truly entering the white, aeon-dead world of the ultimate south. Even as we realized it we saw the peak of <abbr>Mt.</abbr> Nansen in the eastern distance, towering up to its height of almost fifteen thousand feet.</p>
			<p>The successful establishment of the southern base above the glacier in Latitude 86° 7′, East Longitude 174° 23′, and the phenomenally rapid and effective borings and blastings made at various points reached by our sledge trips and short aeroplane flights, are matters of history; as is the arduous and triumphant ascent of <abbr>Mt.</abbr> Nansen by Pabodie and two of the graduate students⁠—Gedney and Carroll⁠—on December 13th to 15th.</p>
			<p>We were some eight thousand five hundred feet above sea level. When experimental drillings revealed solid ground only twelve feet down through the snow and ice at certain points, we made considerable use of the small melting apparatus and sunk bores and performed dynamiting at many places, where no previous explorer had ever thought of securing mineral specimens.</p>
			<p>The pre-Cambrian granites and beacon sandstones thus obtained confirmed our belief that this plateau was homogeneous, with the great bulk of the continent to the west, but somewhat different from the parts lying eastward below South America⁠—which we then thought to form a separate and smaller continent divided from the larger one by a frozen junction of Ross and Weddell Seas, though Byrd has since disproved the report.</p>
			<p>In certain of the sandstones, dynamited and chiseled after boring revealed their nature, we found some highly interesting fossil markings and fragments; notably ferns, seaweeds, trilobites, crinoids, and such mollusks as Linguellae and gastropods⁠—all of which seemed of real significance in connection with the region’s primordial history. There was also a queer triangular, striated marking, about a foot in greatest diameter, which Lake pieced together from three fragments of slate brought up from a deep-blasted aperture.</p>
			<p>These fragments came from a point to the westward, near the Queen Alexandra Range; and Lake, as a biologist, seemed to find their curious marking unusually puzzling and provocative, though to my geological eye it looked not unlike some of the ripple effects reasonably common in the sedimentary rocks.</p>
			<p>Since slate is no more than a metamorphic formation into which a sedimentary stratum is pressed, and since the pressure itself produces odd distorting effects on any markings which may exist, I saw no reason for extreme wonder over the striated depression.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>On January 6, 1931, Lake, Pabodie, Daniels, all six of the students, four mechanics, and myself flew directly over the south pole in two of the great planes, being forced down once by a sudden high wind, which, fortunately, did not develop into a typical storm. This was, as the papers have stated, one of several observation flights, during others of which we tried to discern new topographical features in areas unreached by previous explorers.</p>
			<p>Our early flights were disappointing in this latter respect, though they afforded us some magnificent examples of the richly fantastic and deceptive mirages of the polar regions, of which our sea voyage had given us some brief foretastes.</p>
			<p>Distant mountains floated in the sky as enchanted cities, and often the whole white world would dissolve into a gold, silver, and scarlet land of Dunsanian dreams and adventurous expectancy under the magic of the low midnight sun.</p>
			<p>On cloudy days we had considerable trouble in flying, owing to the tendency of snowy earth and sky to merge into one mystical opalescent void with no visible horizon to mark the junction of the two.</p>
			<p>At length we resolved to carry out our original plan of flying five hundred miles eastward with all four exploring planes and establishing a fresh sub-base at a point which would probably be on the smaller continental division, as we mistakenly conceived it. Geological specimens obtained there would be desirable for purposes of comparison.</p>
			<p>Our health so far had remained excellent⁠—lime juice well offsetting the steady diet of tinned and salted food, and temperatures generally above zero enabling us to do without our thickest furs.</p>
			<p>It was now midsummer, and with haste and care we might be able to conclude work by March and avoid a tedious wintering through the long Antarctic night. Several savage windstorms had burst upon us from the west, but we had escaped damage through the skill of Atwood in devising rudimentary aeroplane shelters and windbreaks of heavy snow blocks, and in reinforcing the principal camp buildings with snow. Our good luck and efficiency had indeed been almost uncanny.</p>
			<p>The outside world knew, of course, of our program, and was told also of Lake’s strange and dogged insistence on a westward⁠—or rather, northwestward⁠—prospecting trip before our radical shift to the new base.</p>
			<p>It seems that he had pondered a great deal and with alarmingly radical daring over that triangular striated marking in the slate; reading into it certain contradictions in nature and geological period which whetted his curiosity to the utmost, and made him avid to sink more borings and blastings in the west-stretching formation to which the exhumed fragments evidently belonged.</p>
			<p>He was strangely convinced that the marking was the print of some bulky, unknown, and radically unclassifiable organism of considerably advanced evolution, notwithstanding that the rock which bore it was of so vastly ancient a date⁠—Cambrian if not actually pre-Cambrian⁠—as to preclude the probable existence not only of all highly evolved life, but of any life at all above the unicellular or at most the trilobite stage. These fragments, with their odd marking, must have been five hundred million to a thousand million years old.</p>
